A description of the creative portion of the assignment
* Describe your feature
I added a Probability fragment that calculates the probability of getting each range. 
* Why did you choose this feature?
I chose this feature because I felt like showing the highest, average and lowest values is not enough to help the friend understand how the probability of getting each range distributes. Giving him the straightforward numbers of probability will help him to see the probability more clearly. 
* How did you implement it?
I made three variables that store the number of times each value range is being rolled as well as the total times the dice is rolled. 
I added a Probability fragment that calculates the probability of getting each value range by dividing the number of times of each value range by the total number of times. 
I also created a xml file that generates the layout for the probability fragment. I implemented a button in every other fragment that will take user to the probability fragment. I also have the buttons that would take user to other fragments in the probability fragment.
